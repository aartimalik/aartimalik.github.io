I am a Senior Research Specialist currently working with [Henrik Kleven](https://www.henrikkleven.com/) at Princeton University.

I am a big tennis fan and love playing badminton. I also love watching movies. If you want to talk about your (or mine) research interests, data, tennis, or movies, please [get in touch](mailto:aartim@mit.edu)! I'd love to hear from you!
