I am a Senior Research Specialist currently working with [Henrik Kleven](https://www.henrikkleven.com/) at Princeton University. Prior to this, I worked as a Research Professional assisting [Delphine Samuels](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/s/delphine-samuels) at the Booth School of Business, University of Chicago. In 2022, I completed a Masters's Econ program at the [Department of Economics](https://econdse.org/) at the Delhi School of Economics. I graduated from [Miranda House College, University of Delhi](https://www.mirandahouse.ac.in/), with a major in Economics and a minor in Mathematics, in 2020. 

I am interested in learning how and why people make decisions and then using them for important policy decisions. I worked with [Kristina Hallez](https://cega.berkeley.edu/user-type/staff/#kristina-hallez), [Supreet Kaur](https://www.supreetkaur.com/), [Ye Rang Park](https://lcdlab.berkeley.edu/people/), and team at [CEGA](https://cega.berkeley.edu/) on an RCT assessing the effect of a direct cash transfer on parent-child interactions. Please get in touch with me to learn more!

As a first-generation student myself, I wish to study more about intergenerational socioeconomic mobility and education in future research by using data and behavioral economics tools.

I am a big tennis fan and love playing badminton. I also love watching movies. If you want to talk about your (or mine!) research interests, data, tennis, or movies, please [get in touch](mailto:aartim@mit.edu)! I'd love to hear from you!
