I am a Research Professional assisting [Delphine Samuels](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/s/delphine-samuels) at the Booth School of Business, University of Chicago. I recently completed a Masters's Econ program at the [Department of Economics](https://econdse.org/) at Delhi School of Economics. I graduated from [Miranda House College, University of Delhi](https://www.mirandahouse.ac.in/), with major in Economics and minor in Mathematics, in 2020. 

I am interested in learning how and why people make decisions and then using it for important policy decisions. I am working with [Kristina Hallez](https://cega.berkeley.edu/user-type/staff/#kristina-hallez), [Supreet Kaur](https://www.supreetkaur.com/), [Ye Rang Park](https://lcdlab.berkeley.edu/people/), and team at [CEGA](https://cega.berkeley.edu/) on an RCT assessing the effect of a direct cash transfer on parent-child interactions! [Meet Mehta](https://twitter.com/meet_econ?lang=en) and I are studying possible behavioral drivers of the differences in early labor outcomes of the first-generation and non-first-generation students. This research is supported by the [Institute of Economic Growth](http://iegindia.org/). Please get in touch with me to learn more!

As a first-generation student myself, I wish to study more about intergenerational socioeconomic mobility and education in future research by using data and behavioral economics tools.

I am a big tennis fan, and love playing badminton. I also love watching movies. If you want to talk about your (or mine!) research interests, data, tennis, or movies, please [get in touch](mailto:aartimalik@uchicago.edu)! I'd love to hear from you!
